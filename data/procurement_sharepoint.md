## Public Procurement Law is changing –The Procurement Act 2023, why you need to know about it and how it impacts you
All procurement colleagues who undertake procurement activity in the Council are required, under the Procurement Act requirements, 
to compete the e-learning programme. This training will assist with understanding regulation changes that will impact all commercial activities. 
Please register here.  If you have any questions regarding the e-learning training, please contact Natalia.Borysik@rbkc.gov.uk.

The Procurement Act 2023 will replace the Public Contract Regulations 2015 this year. The Act will improve the way supplies, services and works are procured in the public sector and impacts how everyone in the Council spends money and enters into contracts. The aim of the Act is to create a simpler and more flexible commercial system that better meets the needs of the suppliers and will embed transparency throughout the commercial lifecycle so the spending of taxpayers’ money can be properly scrutinised.

This legislation will significantly change the way the Council procures and manages contracts, so we need to make a lot of changes to our practises and deliver a large amount of training to make this work. 

This video message from Gareth Rhys Williams, Government Chief Commercial Officer provides contracting authorities with a summary of the new Procurement Act and what steps need to be taken in order to prepare:

## Timeline

The Procurement Bill received Royal Assent in October 2023. In early 2024 secondary legislation will be laid to bring some elements of the Bill and the wider regime into effect. There will be a minimum of six months’ notice before ‘go-live’, which is currently anticipated to be October 2024. The existing legislation will apply until the new regime goes live and will continue to apply to procurements started under the old rules, so any procurement you’ve started before October 2024 will be done on the old rules and anything after then will have to be done on the new rules. 

In addition to the legislative changes, the Strategic Procurement Team will implement a new e-Tendering portal to replace Capital eSourcing early next year, which will no longer be used after June 2024, though anything live at the end of June will be able to be delivered to completion This will ensure that the Council is capable procuring contracts in compliance with the new legislation, and capable of fulfilling the new, complicated transparency requirements throughout the contract lifecycle

## The Delivery Team

The Strategic Procurement Team are facilitating the organisational transition. The team will work closely with Procurement and Contract Managers across the Council, along with colleagues in Finance, Governance, Legal and the Bi-Borough Procurement Service. Further information and ongoing updates will be available via the Strategic Procurement SharePoint and Yammer Pages soon. 

Each Directorate has appointed a Future Operating Model lead who joins the Head of Strategic Procurement and Director of Audit, Frud, Risk and Insurance at a monthly steering group meeting ultimately reporting on progress to the Risk and Control Board at Executive Management Team.

## What do we want to achieve?

In preparation for the reforms, we are focussing on four areas where early consideration and action will allow RBKC to be in the best shape to hit the ground running:
 

Processes and Policies – ensuring procurement processes and policies are robust and fit for purpose.

Systems – ensuring procurement systems are capable of meeting the new requirements.

People – considering the procurement and contracting capabilities across the organisation and identifying who needs to attend the training sessions.

Transition – ensuring the central contract register is up to date, and we have a centralised pipeline of procurement activity over the next 18 months.

## What do we need from you?

In order to transition successfully, the team needs your ongoing support and cooperation. We are currently gathering the following information:
 

The names of Procurement and Contract Managers in your department who will require training on the new regulations and access to the new eTendering portal. Because the laws are changing so significantly a centralised list of trained practitioners will be held in Strategic Procurement to ensure the Council is not exposed to risk by untrained officers attempting procurement.
 

A list of the active contracts in place in your department. As we need to know that we have the skills and resource to support you in all the upcoming contract renewals you have and must publish a pipeline of all upcoming work to the Cabinet Office under the new regulations.
 

A list of the procurement projects planned over the next 18 months. As we need to know that we have the skills and resource to support you in all the upcoming contract renewals you have and must publish a pipeline of all upcoming work to the Cabinet Office under the new regulations.
